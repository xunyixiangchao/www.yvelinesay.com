            My background in corporate real estate strategy and team management has taught me how
              to be focused, organized and to work with others. My fascination for technical skills, and more specifically for logical
              problem solving, lead me to changing careers and becoming a web developer. I am described by others as determined,
              fast-learner and lively minded. I am someone with a strong desire for a challenge, who does what she is passionate about
            with a lot of motivation and precision.
